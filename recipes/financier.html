    </p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Hydrate the Yeast</strong></li>
            Warm the milke to 110-115°F (43-46°C). This can be done on the stove
            or in the microwave. <br>It should take about 30-45 seconds in the 
            microwave.  Sprinkle the yeast over the milk and stir to activate.
            <br><br><b><i>NOTE: Make sure the milk is not too hot or it will kill the yeast!</i></b>
            
            <p></p>
            <li><strong>Add the Butter, Sugar, Salt and Eggs</strong></li>
            In a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer, stir together 
            the cooled butter, sugar, eggs and salt <br>with a spoon or a rubber spatula.
            
            <p></p>
            <li><strong>Add the Milk/Yeast</strong></li>
            Stir in the milk/yeast mixture.
            
            <p></p>
            <li><strong>Add the Flour</strong></li>
            Stir in the flour until it is hydrated. The dough will be shaggy at this point.

            <p></p>
            <li><strong>Knead the Dough</strong></li>
            This dough can be kneaded by hand or with the dough hook of a stand mixer. If kneading 
            by hand, lightly flour <br>a work surface and knead the dough for about 8 minutes, until 
            it is smooth and elastic. The dough will be <br>very sticky to start, but will become 
            less sticky as it is kneaded. If kneading in the stand mixer, knead <br>at medium/high 
            speed for about 6 minutes, stopping about halfway through to scrape the bottom of the bowl.

            <p></p>
            <li><strong>Ferment the Dough</strong>></li>
            Transfer the dough to a clean bowl. Lightly spray the dough with oil and cover the bowl 
            with a towel or plastic <br>wrap. Let the dough ferment at room temperature until doubled 
            in size. This will take about 30-45 minutes if <br>you used quick rise yeast and 1-2 hours
            if active dry yeast was used. A warm spot will speed up the fermentation time.
            
            <p></p>
            <li><strong>Deflate the Dough</strong></li>
            Deflate the air out of the dough by pressing down on it in the center and bringing the edges 
            of the dough over the top.
            
            <p></p>
            <li><stong>Knead in the Pearl Sugar</stong></li>
            Flatten the dough out on a lightly floured work surface and add the pearl sugar. Knead the 
            pearl sugar into the dough <br>until evenly distrubted. Alternatively, you can knead the 
            sugar into the dough in a stand mixer with a dough hook.
            
            <p></p>
            <li><strong>Divide and Rest the Dough</strong></li>
            Divide the dough into roughly 12 pieces and cover with a piece of plastic wrap. Let the 
            dough rest for 10 minutes <br> while the waffle iron heats up.
            
            <p></p>
            <li><strong>Cook the Waffles</strong></li>
            All waffle irons are different so start your iron on a low temperature. Increase 
            the temperature a little <br>at a time to find the setting that will caramelize your 
            sugar. Spray the iron with non-stick spray and <br>put a piece of dough in the center 
            of the waffle iron and close it. The waffle will puff up as it cooks. 
            <br>Cook until golden brown.
