    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Brown the Butter</strong></li>
            Place the butter in a small saucepan. Melt over medium heat. Continue cooking until 
            butter is boiling <br>and turns golden brown and smells nutty, about 8 minutes. Pour into a bowl 
            and cool for 30 minutes.
            
            <p></p>
            <li><strong>Preheat the Oven</strong></li>
            Preheat the oven to 350F. Grease the wells of a mini muffin pan by brushing them lightly
            with softened butter.
            
            <p></p>
            <li><strong>Mix Ingredients</strong></li>
            In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, almond flour, all-purpose flour,
            and salt. Add the egg whites, <br> vanilla, and cooled browned butter. Whisk together until 
            just combined.  (The batter will be thick.)
            
            <p></p>
            <li><strong>Divide the Batter</strong></li>
            Divide the batter among the greased muffin pan cups. Fill about three-quarters to the top.

            <p></p>
            <li><strong>Bake</strong></li>
            Bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until the edges are golden brown and a toothpick inserted 
            into the center comes out clean. <br>Let cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Remove and cool
            completely on a wire rack.
