    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Cupcakes</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preaheat the Oven</strong></li>
        Preheat the oven to 350°F and place cupcake paper liners in the cupcake pan.
        
        <p></p><li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients</strong></li>
        Combine the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking soda, baking powder and salt to the bowl 
        of a stand mixer. <br>Fit the mixer with a paddle attachment and mix on low speed adding 
        the butter a tbsp at a time until a sandy mixture forms.
            
        <p></p><li><strong>Mix Wet Ingredients</strong></li>
        In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, buttermilk, vanilla and food coloring.
            
        <p></p><li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</strong></li>
        Slowly add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients while mixing on low and mix until just
        combined, scraping the bowl as needed.

        <p></p><li><strong>Bake</strong></li>
        Distribute the batter evenly into the cupcake papers and bake at 350°F for 15-20 minutes until
        a toothpick inserted in the middle of <br>the cupcake comes out clean.
    </ol>
    <h3>Cream Cheese Frosting:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cream the Butter</strong></li>
        In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream the butter and cream cheese
        together on medium speed until <br>light and fluffy, about 5 minutes.

        <p></p><li><strong>Add Powdered Sugar</strong></li>
        Reduce speed to low and add powdered sugar 1 cup at a time and mix until combined. 

        <p></p><li><strong>Transfer to Piping Bag and Pipe</strong></li>
        Scrape down the bowl and add to a piping bag fitted with the tip of your choice (I like a star tip).
        Wait for the cupcakes to cool and pipe the frosting.
    </ol>
